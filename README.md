# GameOfLife

This is a simple implementation of the Game of Life.
It contains JavaFX controller for FieldSize, Speed and CanvasSize.
You can add "Mushrooms" randomly or randomly a certain amount.
Changing Speed and adding amounts will not stop the Progres, so you can easily observe new Development.
Anyway: adding by pure Random or changing Field Size will destroy the field and create a new one.
